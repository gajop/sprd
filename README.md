## Examples

Download latest Beyond All Reason:

```
cargo run -- --root-folder ~/projects/spring-dir download byar:test
```


Update metadata:
```
cargo run -- --root-folder ~/projects/spring-dir download-registry
```
```
cargo run -- --root-folder ~/projects/spring-dir download-repo
```


# Development

Install Rust and then build as normal:

```
cargo build
```

### Running tests

To run tests you will need to also have pr-downloader installed - it's used to verify that sprd and pr-downloader output is the same.

If you are on Linux, you can get it as so:
```sh
wget https://github.com/gajop/spring-launcher/blob/master/bin/pr-downloader\?raw\=true -O pr-downloader
chmod +x pr-downloader
```

Tests can only be run in single-threaded mode (the rapid filesystem isn't multi-thread safe yet).
```sh
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```


# :construction: WIP

This project is under construction and not ready for use.

Below you can see my very rough roadmap:

### :construction: In progress:
- New output types: Interactive, Json, Piped (like Interactive but pipable to files), Silent and Auto

### :bookmark: Dev release:
- Improve command naming: download-repo is especially deceptive
- Avoid panic in library code, use explitic errors instead of `<dyn Error>`
- Pool downloader autofix files
- Check validity of other metadata files too: save size & gz validity
- Auto-retry
- Statically link it

### :memo: TODO:

Pool downloader:
- pool downloader tests without internet connectivity (save downloads to files)
- Back to fully async IO (file): use tokio::fs, figure out what was causing the partial write issue despite write_all

Commands:
- Refactor commands out of lib.rs, they're only sensible to have for the binary. We don't want library authors to use the command API

Downloader:
- Option to not commit metadata downloads until pool finishes
- Option to download in parallel (?)
- Make it possible to specify the server URLs
